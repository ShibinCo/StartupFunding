**ARR:** Annual revenue run rate; the revenue for the last month multiplied times 12 months as an estimate of the total revenue rate for the year.

**Angel Investor:** Wealthy individuals that invest in startups in their early stages of development or seed round of fundraising. Due to the inherent risk of loss of capital or significant dilution in subsequent fundraising, angel investors typically pursue investments with returns that they believe may have the potential to return multiples of the initial investment.

**Anti-dilution Clause:** Contractual clause that protects an investor from having their investment as a percentage of ownership significantly reduced in subsequent rounds of fundraising. Technically the provision increases the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a convertible security or upon exercise of a warrant or option upon the occurrence of specified events, usually the issuance of more shares for a low price.

**Blended Preferences:** When all classes of preferred stock have equal payment rights in the event of a liquidation

**Bootstrapping:** Business strategy by which a startup self-finances, eliminating the need for seed or angel investment. Typically achieved through lean operation and a product that generates revenue early in the companies life cycle.

**Conversion Rate or Ratio:** Means the number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of Preferred Stock is convertible.

**Common Stock:** A type of equity security, contrasted with preferred shares. Common stock is most frequently issued to founders, management, and employees. In a liquidation event, preferred shares generally take priority over common shares.

**Control Rights:** Rights of an investor or shareholder relating to control over the company‚Äôs affairs. Control rights typically relate to voting or designation of board seats, voting \(e.g., does a class of securities give the holder 10 votes per share?\), and certain actions \(e.g., incurring indebtedness\) which require the consent of a majority of a certain class or series of security.

**Convertible Debt:** A loan that allows the lender to exchange the debt for common stock at a predetermined ratio instead of recollecting the principle as cash.

**Convertible:** The right of the investor to convert shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate stated in the corporate charter. Conversion is usually automatic upon the occurrence of a Qualified IPO. Mandatory conversion is necessary because companies sell Common Stock in their IPOs and new investors are not likely to purchase Common Stock, if earlier investors retain Preferred Stock with superior rights.

**Covenant:** The obligation in a contract to do something. An obligation to refrain from doing something is called a Negative Covenant. For example, the obligation to obtain life insurance on key employees is a covenant and the obligation to not deviate from the budget approved by investors is a negative covenant.

**Cumulative Dividend:** If the dividend is not declared during the period stated in the corporate charter, the dividend accrues and is payable in a later period. If a dividend right isn‚Äôt cumulative, the dividend would be lost forever if it‚Äôs not declared during the period stated in the corporate charter. Accrued but unpaid dividends are sometimes convertible into shares of Common Stock.

**Cutback Rights:** Where shareholders exercise piggyback registration rights, but there are too many shares for the underwriters to sell in the public offering without adversely affecting the price, cutback rights determine whose shares are left out of the offering and whose shares are included in the offering.

**Demand Registration Rights:** The right of investors to require the company to register the investors‚Äô shares for sale to the public even if the company was not otherwise planning to conduct a public offering. Usually, an investor or group of investors receives one or two Demand Registration Rights. Typically, the right isn‚Äôt exercisable until after the company‚Äôs initial public offering or after a stated time period.

**Dilution:** Generally speaking, as subsequent financing rounds occur, existing investors will own proportionally less of the company than they did previously since additional equity is generally issued as part of a new financing round. Dilution is not necessarily a bad thing \_ since new stock can be issued at a higher price, you may own a smaller piece of a larger company, which means the value of your investment is actually higher than it was previously.

**Down Round:** A fundraising round in which the company is valued at a lower value per share than previous rounds. This results in dilution for existing shareholders unless anti-dilution provisions are put in place.

**Drag-Along Rights:** The right of the owners of a specified percentage of the shares of the company to require other shareholders to sell their shares or to vote their shares to approve sale of the company. This prevents one group of shareholders from blocking sale of the company to someone who is only interested in purchasing 100% ownership of the company.

**Due Diligence:**

The process performed by prospective investors to assess the viability of an investment and confirm that the information provided by the company is accurate.

**Exit Velocity:** A term from baseball originally referring to the speed of the baseball as it comes off the bat, immediately after a batter makes contact. In venture it refers to the speed between investment and exit, immediately when the investment is made to the liquidity event that allows the investor to cash out. Example ‚Äî capital invested for growth funds has a higher exit velocity than capital invested by accelerators in startups because the ventures are less mature and have a longer time to exit.

**Exit Event or Liquidity Event:** When an issuer engages in a transaction that allows investors to sell their shares, which generally happens through a tender offer \(sale\) or an IPO.

**Fair Market Value:** The value of a company based on what investors are willing to pay for it. For private companies or illiquid assets, ‚Äúfair market value‚Äù is generally derived from comparable companies or assets that have recently had a transaction associated with them.

**Fiduciary:** Someone who owes special duties to another person and who has liability for not performing that duty.

**First Refusal Rights:** The right to purchase stock in future offerings by the company on the same terms as other investors. Usually the right is designed to enable investors to maintain their percentage ownership of the company by purchasing a pro rata share of all new stock sold by the company. Investors also often require company founders to grant first refusal rights on shares the founders own. Also sometimes called Preemptive Rights.

**Friends and Family Round:** Capital provided by the friends and family of founders of an early stage startup. This is typically its first outside capital. The startup is generally too early \(often still at ideation\) to raise capital from professional angel or seed investors, but needs capital to get started.

**Full Ratchet:** The method of total protection from dilution is called a full ratchet and ensures that should a fundraising round cause a previous investor‚Äôs ownership percentage to decrease as a result of newly issued shares, they will be given the opportunity to maintain their ownership level.

In more technical terms, it is a type of Anti-dilution Protection that adjusts the Conversion Ratio so that each share of Preferred Stock will be convertible into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of shares the investor would have received, if the investor had purchased the shares at the lowest subsequent price at which the company later sells its stock. The number of shares sold at the lower price doesn‚Äôt matter. Only the lower price matters. For example, if the company sells Preferred Stock with a one-for-one Conversion Ratio for $10 per share and later sells Common Stock for $1 per share, each share of Preferred Stock would become convertible into ten shares of Common Stock, even if only one share is sold at the lower price.

**Fully Diluted:** Fully diluted means the total number of shares of Common Stock the company has issued, plus all shares of Common Stock issuable if all outstanding options, warrants, convertible preferred stock and convertible debt were to be exercised or converted. Fully diluted calculations are used to compare the percentage ownership of a company of different classes of securities by reducing each class to its Common Stock equivalent.

**K1:** The [Schedule K-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/schedule-k-1.asp) is an Internal Revenue Service \(IRS\) tax form issued annually for an investment in partnership interests. The purpose of the Schedule K-1 is to report each partner‚Äôs share of the partnership‚Äôs earnings, losses, deductions, and credits. It serves a similar purpose for tax reporting as one of the various Forms 1099, which report dividend or interest from securities or income from the sale of securities. This document is sent to LP investors by the fund that tells investors the percentage of the profits and losses of the fund that they are responsible for.

**Key man clause:** Clause in the LPA that enables the LP to break the agreement if one of the major GPs in the fund leave.

**Key man risk:** Referred to as the risk associated with depending on a single charismatic individual in a startup; key tactic is to build a strong capable team around the individual, usually the founder, to mitigate this risk.

**Investment Syndicate:** A group of investors that agree to participate in an investment round of funding for a company.

**Investor‚Äôs Rights Agreement:** An agreement that is frequently required by early, or large, investors in a company. This agreement may include many provisions, such as ‚ÄúFirst Offer‚Äù \(the right, but not the obligation, to participate in future fundraising rounds\) and ‚ÄúObserver Rights‚Äù \(the right to observe board meetings\). This provision is relevant to shareholders because it may include a separate right of first refusal for investors.

**Issuer:** The entity / company that shares represent ownership in.

Includes several provisions related to early stage companies, including new regulation regarding the maximum number of shareholders private companies are allowed and changes to the method in which companies can solicit private investors.

**Letter of Intent \(LOI\):** A letter of intent \(LOI\) is similar to a memorandum of understanding \(MOU\) in that it is a common agreement between businesses \(including startups\) and potential customers to define commitment, interest, terms, and pricing in writing prior to delivering the good or service. This document is used to clarify understanding of both the customer and founder and often used to show investors. LOI and MOU agreements are used interchangeably and usually non-binding. At times, in working with customers on large projects with multiple phases where the customer and business work together before payment and services are exchanged a MOU may be used before a LOI is used to define pricing and terms. Also see Memorandum of Understanding \(MOU\).

**Limited Partner \(LP\):** Limited Partner, typically funds 99‚Äì100% of a fund, major investors

**Lead investor:** The investor who takes on most of the work in negotiating the investment terms, doing due diligence and monitoring the company after the closing.

**Liquidation:** An event that could result in either investors or debt holders to receive cash from the company, either through acquisition or a sale of assets resulting from bankruptcy. In either case, preference clauses determine order of payout to claimants, typically valuing debt holders and preferred shareholders over common stockholders.

**Liquidation Preference:** The order in which investors, or debt holders, get paid in the event of company liquidation or bankruptcy. Commonly used by venture capitalists to ensure they see a return on their investment in different liquidation scenarios.

Venture capital fund management fees typically range from 1‚Äì3% annually \(usually 2%\) and are generally charged based on committed capital during the investment period, and then invested capital after the investment period has finished.

**Memorandum of Understanding \(MOU\):** The memorandum of understanding \(MOU\) is a common agreement between startups who are pre-product and potential customers to define commitment, interest, terms, and pricing in writing prior to delivering the good or service. LOI and MOU agreements are used interchangeably and usually non-binding. At times the MOU is used in partnerships to define working relationships where no financial exchange is yet made. At times, in working with customers on large projects with multiple phases where the customer and business work together before payment and services are exchanged a MOU may be used before a LOI is used to define pricing and terms. This document is usually also used to clarify understanding of both the customer and founder and often used to show investors. Also see Letter of Intent \(LOI\).

**Milestone:** An event that triggers another investment by the venture investors.

**Non binding:** Refers to the depth of the legal commitment of the document. Term sheets, Memorandums of Understanding \(MOUs\), Letters of Intent \(LOIs\) are non-binding documents of which the investor or startup can back out of the intended agreement. The etiquette in venture is to provide a term sheet and once the founder agrees to the term sheet move to execute the investment. It is not common for investors to back out of agreements once a term sheet is issued.

**‚ÄòNo shop‚Äô clause:** The clause in a term sheet that states to the founder they are not to share the term sheet with other investors in order to receive a competing offer. This is a standard clause.

**Option Pool:** A number of shares of Common Stock specified in the corporate charter that can be sold to employees, officers and directors at low prices without triggering the Price Anti-dilution Protection of the Preferred Stock. 15% of the fully diluted shares is fairly typical, although the size of the Option Pool usually depends on the number of shares estimated to be necessary to grant to employees to attract a team capable of achieving the goals of the company‚Äôs business plan. This varies from one company to another. Option Pool shares are usually considered to be outstanding shares when calculating the company‚Äôs valuation.

**Over allotment Option:** The right of investors to exercise the First Refusal Rights and Come Along Rights of other investors who don‚Äôt exercise their own rights.

**Participating Preferred Stock:**

A class of stock with a Liquidation Preference, whereby on liquidation, sale or merger of the company, the owner has the right to share on an equal basis with holders of Common Stock any money or other assets that remain for distribution after payment of the Liquidation Preference of the Preferred Stock. With Nonparticipating Preferred Stock, the holders of Preferred Stock must choose either to receive their Liquidation Preference or to receive the same distribution holders of Common Stock receive. A holder of Participating Preferred Stock doesn‚Äôt have to choose and receives both.

**Pay to Play:** In venture capital, investors can raise the ante with co-investors by means of a ‚Äúpay-to-play‚Äù provision, requiring that all investors in a portfolio company continue their pro rata financial commitment to the company, or else lose certain rights with respect to their original investment. The rights can often be anti-dilution rights. In some cases there is a provision of a portion of pro rata \(e.g. 50%\) or investors convert to common equity.

**Preemptive Rights:** Similar to rights of first refusal. The term preemptive rights refers to the right to purchase a company‚Äôs new shares before they are offered to anyone else. In term sheets the preemptive rights provision may be titled ‚ÄúRight to Participate Pro Rata in Future Rounds‚Äù. This is standard in term sheets.

**Preferred Stock:** A class of stock with a Liquidation Preference; that is, the right to receive distributions of money or assets prior to one or more other classes of stock if the company is sold, merged or liquidated. This protects investors by ensuring the investors get their money back \(and sometimes a fixed return on the investment\) before holders of Common Stock receive any money or assets.

**Pre-Money Valuation:** The theoretical value of the company before the investment agreed upon by the company and the investors. Pre- Money Valuation is calculated by multiplying the number of Fully Diluted shares of the company before the investment transaction by the purchase price per share in the investment transaction.

**Price Anti-dilution Protection:** Protects investors from overpaying for stock by adjusting the Conversion Ratio if the company later issues shares for a price less than the price the investors paid. Adjustment of the Conversion Ratio results in more shares of Common Stock becoming issuable upon conversion of each share of Preferred Stock than was agreed at the time of the investment. There are two basic types of Price Anti-dilution Protection; Full Ratchet and Weighted Average. Weighted Average can be either Broad Based or Narrow Based.

**Protective Provisions:** The right of an investor or group of investors to veto certain transactions by the company. This is usually achieved by prohibiting certain transactions, unless they are approved by a class vote of the Preferred Stock.

**Pari passu:** Legal term that refers to equal treatment for two or more parties in an agreement meaning ‚Äúon the same terms as‚Äù.

**Participating Preferred:** For the term, the Participating preferred stockholders are entitled to receive a share of any remaining liquidation proceeds on an as-converted to common stock basis, after they have already gotten back their liquidation preference, whereas non-participating preferred stock holders either get \(i\) their liquidation preference back, or \(ii\) the amount they would have gotten had they converted to common stock. In other words, participating preferred gets the original capital back and the share of ownership. This term is sometimes referred to as investors double dipping as investors are getting the capital and the ownership versus just the percentage of the capital. [More here](https://www.lightercapital.com/blog/participating-or-non-participating-preferred-stock-whats-the-difference/).

An IPO with $20 million in gross proceeds to the company and a price per share three times the price the investor paid for its stock is fairly typical for a Qualified IPO, but this varies from one deal to another.

**Roll up:** A Rollup \(also ‚ÄúRoll-up‚Äù or ‚ÄúRoll up‚Äù\) is a process used by investors \(commonly private equity firms\) where multiple small companies in the same market are acquired and merged. The principal aim of a rollup is to reduce costs through economies of scale.

**Ratchet:** A provision that provides an investor with down-round protection \(i.e., where the company raises a subsequent round of financing, which can include IPO, at a lower price\) by providing for the issuance of additional shares in the subsequent round. In the IPO context, a ratchet provision provides that if the IPO price does not meet a certain level, say at least the price paid by the investor in the private round or some baked in rate of return above that price, the IPO conversion of those shares to common shares is adjusted such that an additional number of shares are issued to investors which would meet the predetermined level.

It refers to the financial performance of a company based on using current financial information as a predictor of future performance. The run rate functions as an extrapolation of current financial performance and is based on the assumption that current conditions will continue. Run rates are useful for new business or business units within a company that have only had a short period of revenue generation opportunity. This figure allows managers, venture capitalists and investors to measure the annualized revenue.

**Vesting:** Generally, when something that is promised is delivered and ownership is officially granted to the recipient. For employees, shares generally vest according to a predetermined schedule. Vesting effectively means that employees only receive their equity compensation after a period of employment to ensure alignment of interest between the company and the employee. The current market standard for vesting schedules is 4 years with a one-year ‚Äúcliff‚Äù. Typically, this means that 25% of the grant will vest after one year, and the balance will vest in equal monthly installments over the following 36 months.

**Warrant:** The right to purchase stock at a later date at a fixed price. Similar to stock options, but usually given to investors, not employees.

**Warrant Coverage:** Warrants issued to reward bridge loan lenders, guarantors or other lenders for incurring the risk of lending. The number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is based on a percentage of the debt.

**Washout Round:** A round of financing where previous investors, the founders, and management suffer significant dilution. The new investor in a washout round will typically gain majority ownership and control of the company.

**Weighted Average:** A form of Anti-dilution Protection that adjusts the Conversion Ratio according to a formula that takes into account both the lower price and the number of shares issued at the lower price. This is more favorable to the company than a Full Ratchet. Narrow Based Weighted Average uses only the number of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock in the formula used to adjust the conversion price. This is more favorable to the investor than Broad Based Weighted Average, which includes all fully diluted shares in its formula.

**Write-Off:** A decrease in the reported value of an asset or company.
